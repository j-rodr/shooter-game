# **3. Shooter Game**
For my third portfolio project I decided to create a shooter game with vanilla JavaScript. I intended to practice my knowledge about objects, arrays, higher-order functions, OOP, event handlers, `localStorage`, and `requestAnimationFrame`. 

## **Gameplay**
**The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible in 2 minutes.**
- Move with your keyboard keys or holding and moving your mouse.
- You lose a life when getting hit by an alien missile.
- Shoot missiles to kill aliens pressing the spacebar.
- You lose the game when dying or by colliding with an alien.
- You get 10 points on each alien kill.
- You lose 5 points every time you don't kill an alien.
